WorldMap is a simple Android app that displays a map of the world taken from Wikimedia (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Physical_Political_World_Map.jpg), and allows the user to scroll around on it.

The map itself is quite large (6480,3888), so it's way too big to fit in memory all at once (6480 x 3888 x 16 / 8) = 50,388,480 -- over 48 megs. The VM heap size Android supports is eith 16 or 24 megs, so we can't fit the whole thing in memory at once.

So WorldMap uses the BitmapRegionDecoder API (available as of API 10) to decode just what it needs to display.

120410-initial The initial version is quite dumb. It's able to track
               the user, but it decodes the entire bitmap each time,
               making the user experience quite choppy.



Road Map
--------
* Refactor the code.
* Work on getting the frame rate up
  * Instead of decoding the entire bitmap each time, decode just what's necesary to fill in the offset.
  * Investigate the use of animation between cycles
  * Perhaps use surfaceview

* backport BitmapRegionDecoder to 2.2 or use a different library with JNI.

* Add flinging to move quickly across the map

* Add zooming to infinite levels
  * start with the map fully unzoomed
  * Calculate where in the world we are once we get to a certain level, then create an intent to start Google Maps.
